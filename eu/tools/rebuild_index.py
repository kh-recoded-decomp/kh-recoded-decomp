"""Rebuild build/func_index.json from FIRST PRINCIPLES: the extracted module binaries plus the
dsd config (symbols.txt / relocs.txt / delinks.txt).

The delink objects only contain the functions that are still gaps: once a function has a
source it leaves them, so an index built from delinks can never cover finished functions.

A function's bytes are just the ROM at its address, and its relocations are in relocs.txt. Neither
depends on what has been decompiled, so this reconstruction is complete and stable: it indexes all
of them, done or not, and can be re-run at any time.

At a relocated word an entry holds the ROM's linked value. Every consumer of this index
(verify_idx.py, dedupprop.py, port_days.py) masks relocated words before comparing; do not
"fix" this by zeroing the words, because the opcode byte of a `bl` lives in the same word.

Default is a dry run that VERIFIES itself against the entries already in the index; pass --write
to merge the missing ones in.

Usage:  python tools/rebuild_index.py [--write]
