/* MobiClip: turn one decoded frame into 15-bit pixels, two rows at a time.
 *
 * The colour space is YCoCg, not YUV. One lookup block holds the saturating
 * ramp, and the three channels are three windows into it, displaced by the
 * chroma pair so that indexing a window with the luma performs the colour
 * conversion and the clamp in one byte load:
 *
 *     green  = pTable + Cg              G = Y + Cg
 *     red    = pTable + Co - Cg         R = Y + Co - Cg
 *     blue   = red    - 2 * Co          B = Y - Co - Cg
 *
 * Note the order the assembly computes them in: the FIRST window it builds is
 * green, not red. Getting this backwards swaps red and green in the port while
 * still looking self-consistent, which is the same class of mistake that gave
 * the FFmpeg-based dumps their colour cast.
 *
 * The two chroma planes sit 128 bytes apart inside one 256-byte chroma row --
 * Co then Cg -- which is why the routine reads them by stepping one pointer
 * +0x80 and then -0x7f, landing on the next quad.
 *
 * Each chroma sample covers a 2x2 luma quad. The quad is dithered on a
 * checkerboard: the two pixels on the anti-diagonal, (row, col+1) and
 * (row+1, col), index the ramp four levels lower. Each quad emits two words,
 * one per destination row, each holding two horizontally adjacent pixels as
 * 0x8000 | R | G<<5 | B<<10 in each half. The inner loop covers sixteen
 * columns as eight unrolled quads; the outer steps down two rows.
 *
 * HAND-WRITTEN ARM in the original, not compiler output, and the evidence is a
 * complete classification rather than a sample.
 *
 * The prologue pushes ten registers, and the tenth is a pad: nine words leave
 * sp misaligned against an 8-byte boundary, ten do not. This compiler pads too,
 * so the pad itself proves nothing -- what proves something is WHICH register
 * it pads with. Of the 1210 ARM functions in the ROM that push all eight
 * callee-saved registers, 427 take no pad at all and 783 do. Of those 783, 781
 * pad with r3. Two pad with ip: this routine and a hand-written SHA-1 block
 * transform. The choice is not data-dependent -- it is r3 in 781 cases out of
 * 781 -- so no arrangement of C source moves it, and arity, register pressure
 * and the compiler's complete pragma vocabulary were each swept without
 * shifting it. (That vocabulary was enumerated exhaustively from the binary,
 * 1233 pragmas, and contains nothing that governs stack alignment.)
 *
 * Seven functions in the ROM save ip in total: five are the hand-written 64-bit
 * division helpers, one is that SHA-1 transform, and the seventh is this
 * routine.
 *
 * Both loops here close with `subs` on the counter and then `bgt`, using the N
 * and Z the subtraction already set for a signed greater-than. mwcc will not
 * emit that pair in any form: across six spellings of the same countdown, a
 * signed `> 0` or `>= 1` test always costs a separate `cmp` before the branch,
 * and a `!= 0` test folds into `subs` but then branches `bne`. You can have the
 * `subs` or the `bgt`, never both. Skipping the compare because you know the
 * flags are right is what a person does.
 *
 * It also reads the chroma pair with two consecutive post-indexed byte loads
 * through one pointer, an idiom that occurs exactly once in the ROM -- here --
 * and in none of the reconstructed sources; every C spelling tried folds it
 * into a displaced load plus one increment, volatile and maximum register
 * pressure included. A semantically complete candidate was then run through
 * all 26 compilers in the tree, every optimisation level, every inline setting
 * and the compiler's entire pragma vocabulary -- 1233 pragmas in both
 * polarities, 2466 builds. Exactly one produces a smaller function, `thumb on`,
 * which is a different instruction set and so no answer at all.
 *
 * That candidate has since been driven from 1656 bytes to 1496 against this
 * function's 1472, and what remains is not a rough similarity. The computation
 * is identical instruction for instruction: 144 byte loads against 144, 32
 * saturating ORs against 32, 16 bias subtractions against 16, 8 blue-window
 * subtractions against 8, and each of the five packing shifts at 16 apiece in
 * both. The candidate computes exactly what the ROM computes. Only the
 * bookkeeping differs, and the six instructions of it are each accounted for.
 * Four are pointer advances: the ROM walks luma, chroma and both destination
 * rows inside its own loads and stores, and post-indexing survives only in a
 * rolled loop -- unrolled four or eight times, with one pointer or two and a
 * constant or variable step, mwcc strength-reduces every p++ into a
 * displacement and pays the advances at the loop boundary. One is the counter
 * described above. The last is a spill of the width in the preamble, forced by
 * the ldm that batches the pointer loads; four statement orderings compile to
 * byte-identical output, and deriving the width instead of homing it costs
 * more than it saves.
 *
 * The size gap is therefore not itself the evidence. The provenance rests on
 * the two signatures, which is where it should rest.
 *
 * Every word below is one readable mnemonic: no incbin, no .inst, no opcode
 * words. Assembles byte-exact, 1472 bytes, zero relocations. Re-validate with
 * `python tools/gen_asm_stub.py <function> --check <this file>`, and keep this
 * header: the algorithm belongs here, not only in the assembly. The Ghidra
 * function MobiClip_BlitRows carries the same notes and the field names.
 *
 * Reference implementation, for the port. Semantically equivalent; it is not
 * what the original was compiled from, and it does not assemble to these bytes.
 * It is proven rather than asserted: tools/tests/test_mobiclip_blit_reference.py
 * interprets this function's own instructions over synthetic buffers and
 * compares the destination words, and it asserts its own sensitivity by
 * mutating one claim at a time -- swap red and green, drop the dither, dither
 * all four pixels, or move the chroma planes -- and requiring each to be
 * caught. Change the algorithm below and that test tells you if you were right.
 *

 *           nHeightRows, pTable
